#   ./ralph.sh build              # Implement tasks one at a time (unlimited)
#   ./ralph.sh build 5            # Implement up to 5 tasks
#   ./ralph.sh plan 1 "add navigation step tracking when URL changes"

#   progress.md      — Tracks completed work (Claude updates this after each task)

1. Read the PRD (PROMPT_build.md) and the progress file (progress.md).
2. Find the next incomplete task — the first one not yet marked done in progress.md.
3. Implement that single task. Write code, add tests if appropriate.
4. Commit your changes with a clear message describing what you did -> feat(*): implemented x [branch].
5. Update progress.md to reflect the completed task and current test counts.

2. Review what has been built so far vs. what remains in the plan.${FEATURE_LINE}
3. Add new phases/tasks to PROMPT_build.md for the requested work.
4. Ensure tasks are small, concrete, and ordered by dependency.
5. Commit the updated plan.
6. Update progress.md if any structural changes were made.
ONLY PLAN — do not implement any code. Stop after committing the updated plan."
